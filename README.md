TODO:
- Write the readme:
    - How to install and use
    - Architecture overview
    - Images ?
  
- Decide whether or not the project stays as a package or if it will be moved as a repo to clone in the Assets folder
  - If repo to clone: the main branch would be the base project and a new branch could be created for each project using the framework
- Add timed screen transition (time to wait between show and hide anims)
